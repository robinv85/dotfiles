Dotfiles
========

My OS X & \*nix configuration settings. 
Disclaimer: I'm still learning git, and I'm fairly new to OS X and Linux/Unix so this repo is still heavily under construction, use at your own risk (careful with overwriting files)

Todo
-----

* Group into folders
* Figure out vim bundles / git submodules
* Improve installer: different OS's, protect overwriting files, make backup, uninstall, bash commands
* put editor preferences into editorconfig..

Installation
------------

Clone this repo anywhere, e.g. to ~/dots, then run bootstrap.sh and the following files are automatically symlinked into your $HOME directory.

    .profile
    .bash_profile
    .bashrc
    .vimrc
    .osx
