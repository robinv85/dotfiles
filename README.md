Dotfiles
========

My OS X & *nix configuration settings. Still working on this.

Installation
------------

Clone this repo anywhere, preferably in ~/dotfiles or similar, then run install.sh and the following files are automatically symlinked into your $HOME directory.

.profile
.bash_profile
.bashrc
.vimrc
