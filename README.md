Dotfiles
========

My OS X & \*nix configuration settings. Still under construction, use at your own risk (careful with overwriting files)
Todo: group into folders, improve installer, put editor preferences into editorconfig...

Installation
------------

Clone this repo anywhere, e.g. to ~/dotfiles, then run install.sh and the following files are automatically symlinked into your $HOME directory.

    *.profile
    *.bash_profile
    *.bashrc
    *.vimrc
    *.osx
